# roon-on-wine
Running Roon with Wine on Linux

This script makes it possible to run Roon on Wine.
It creates a separate Wine instance in a folder; this is required for Roon.

Right now the script is very rudimentary: more stuff coming soon.

Keep in mind that you need the following programs to be installed on your Linux system:

wine
winecfg
wget
