# Running Roon on Linux with Wine

This script makes it possible to run Roon on Wine.
It creates a separate Wine instance in a folder; this is required for Roon.

Right now the script is very rudimentary: more stuff coming soon. Keep in mind that you need the following programs to be installed on your Linux system:

* wine
* winecfg
* wget

To install Roon just clone or download this reposity and run <code>./installer.sh</code>
